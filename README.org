The static website generator for Wei.

* Overview
This is the static website generator Wei uses for many of its
websites, including That World, Core Paper and others.

* Extensions
- =jsondoc=: Bundled document, where the =content= attribute is
  interpreted as plaintext. If the file ends with =html.jsondoc=,
  cross-reference processor will replace links in the HTML with the
  approriate values and process special =xref= macros. Otherwise,
  cross-reference will only handle those special =xref= macros.

* Cross-reference macros
- =XREFLINK=: Replaced with link-style location to target.
- =XREFPATH=: Replaced with path-style location to target (resolve to
  a file name).
- =XREFFULLLINK=: Similar to =XREFLINK=, but with full URL (including
  domain name).
